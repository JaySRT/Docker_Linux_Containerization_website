                <h1 class="mt-5">What is Virtualization? </h1>
                <p>Virtualization is technology that lets you create useful IT services using resources that are
                    traditionally bound to hardware. It allows you to use a physical machine’s full capacity by
                    distributing its capabilities among many users or environments</p>
                <p>In more practical terms, imagine you have 3 physical servers with individual dedicated purposes.
                    One is a mail server, another is a web server, and the last one runs internal legacy applications.
                    Each server is being used at about 30% capacity—just a fraction of their running potential. But
                    since the legacy apps remain important to your internal operations, you have to keep them and the
                    third server that hosts them, right?
                </p>
                <p> <img src="Images/server-usage-500x131.png" alt="Docker hello-world" width="500" height="131"></p>
                <p> Traditionally, yes. It was often easier and more reliable to run individual tasks on individual servers: 1 server,
                    1 operating system, 1 task. It wasn’t easy to give 1 server multiple brains. But with virtualization, you can split
                    the mail server into 2 unique ones that can handle independent tasks so the legacy apps can be migrated. It’s the same
                    hardware, you’re just using more of it more efficiently.
                </p>
                <p> <img src="Images/server-usage-for-virtualization-500x131.png" alt="Docker hello-world" width="500" height="131"> </p>

                <p> Keeping security in mind, you could split the first server again so it could handle another task—increasing its use from 30%, to 60%, to 90%.
                    Once you do that, the now empty servers could be reused for other tasks or retired altogether to reduce cooling and maintenance costs.
                </p>
                <h2 class="mt-5">How does it work? </h2>
                <p> Software called hypervisors separate the physical resources from the virtual environments—the things that need those resources.
                    Hypervisors can sit on top of an operating system (like on a laptop) or be installed directly onto hardware (like a server), which is
                    how most enterprises virtualize. Hypervisors take your physical resources and divide them up so that virtual environments can use them.
                </p>

                <h2 class="mt-5"> Types of Virtualization </h2>
                <h5 class="mt-5"> Data virtualization </h5>
                <p> Data that’s spread all over can be consolidated into a single source. Data virtualization allows companies to treat data as a dynamic supply—providing '=
                    processing capabilities that can bring together data from multiple sources, easily accommodate new data sources, and transform data according to user needs.
                    Data virtualization tools sit in front of multiple data sources and allows them to be treated as single source, delivering the needed data—in the required
                    form—at the right time to any application or user.

                <h5 class="mt-5"> Desktop virtualization </h5>
                <p> Easily confused with operating system virtualization—which allows you to deploy multiple operating systems on a single machine—desktop virtualization allows a
                    central administrator (or automated administration tool) to deploy simulated desktop environments to hundreds of physical machines at once. Unlike traditional
                    desktop environments that are physically installed, configured, and updated on each machine, desktop virtualization allows admins to perform mass configurations,
                    updates, and security checks on all virtual desktops.
                </p>
                <p> <img src="Images/Virtual_desktop.jpg" alt="Docker hello-world" width="750" height="500"> </p>

                <h5 class="mt-5"> Server virtualization </h5>
                <p> Servers are computers designed to process a high volume of specific tasks really well so other computers—like laptops and desktops—can do a
                    variety of other tasks. Virtualizing a server lets it to do more of those specific functions and involves partitioning it so that the components
                    can be used to serve multiple functions.
                </p>
                <p> <img src="Images/what-is-server-virtualization.png" alt="Docker hello-world" width="800" height="400"> </p>

                <h5 class="mt-5"> Operating system virtualization </h5>
                <p> Operating system virtualization happens at the kernel—the central task managers of operating systems. It’s a useful way to run Linux and Windows
                    environments side-by-side. Enterprises can also push virtual operating systems to computers, which:
                </p>
                <li> Reduces bulk hardware costs, since the computers don’t require such high out-of-the-box capabilities.</li>
                <li> Increases security, since all virtual instances can be monitored and isolated.</li>
                <li> Limits time spent on IT services like software updates.</li>
